# Oil Well Pressure Monitor (Python)

This project simulates an IoT sensor for real-time pressure monitoring in Upstream oil operations.

## ⚓ Overview
In oil field operations, maintaining pressure within safety limits is critical for asset integrity. This Python script simulates real-time data ingestion from an oil well and triggers automated alerts based on predefined safety thresholds.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Real-time Simulation:** Generates PSI readings to mimic field sensor data.
* **Automated Alert System:** Logic-based notifications when pressure exceeds 2500 PSI.
* **Operational Focus:** Designed with industrial safety protocols in mind.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python 3.x**
